# EthicalJS: Why Your Next Framework Should Be An Ethical One

## Description

As software engineers, we love to debate what frameworks we use to do our work. We argue with passion whether this one is better than that one. We evaluate their merits, make a decision, and live with the consequences (until a rewrite, of course). But some decisions we make have greater consequences than a change in the bundle size or the bottom line. Some choices we make have real ethical consequences. Volkswagen falsifies emissions tests with software. Uber drivers can avoid cops with software. The state of Hawaii is sent into a panic with software. Maybe a new coding framework isn't what we need next. Maybe the next framework we need is one that guides our ethical discussions about software instead.

## Alternate Description

As developers, we love to debate frameworks passionately. We evaluate their merits, choose one, and live with the consequences (until a rewrite, of course). But some decisions we make have greater consequences than a change in the bundle size or the bottom line. Some choices have real ethical consequences. Software allowed Volkswagen to falsify emissions tests, Uber drivers to avoid cops, and sent the state of Hawaii into a panic. Maybe a new coding framework isn't what we need next, but rather a framework that guides our ethical discussions about software instead.

## Notes and Comments

This talk focuses on why philosophy, specifically the study of ethics, is important for software engineers.

Many students spend the majority of their academic lives learning logic and critical thinking as byproducts to other subjects. Some students never formally study logic or ethics. These subjects fall under the purview of philosophy. This talk demonstrates why studying logic and ethics directly is necessary in our current industry.

We love to debate the benefits of this or that JavaScript framework, when what we urgently need are ethical frameworks. A software engineer is in jail currently for writing code that falsified emissions tests for Volkswagen. Uber created software so their drivers could operate in cities illegally and avoid the police. Facebook's privacy settings destroyed a young woman's relationship with her family. The most recent software-turned-ethical-nightmare is the Hawaiian missile false alarm, where poorly designed software sent an entire state into panic. We can do better. Part of doing better is having the tools and education to evaluate the software we write more critically and ethically.

The talk will consist of an introduction to the problem as I've described above. Next, it will establish some of the reasons why we need to start studying ethics using the examples mentioned previously. Then, the talk will discuss some of the basics of the field of ethics and directly apply them to software processes. For example, we already do code reviews, what if we did ethics reviews as well? What if premortems were just as common as postmortems for projects ("What could go wrong?" long before "What did go wrong?")? This talk ends with a call to action, asking the audience to consider the ramifications of our work before we build it. In other words, we should focus as much on _why_ we build software, as we do on _how_ we build software.

## Audience

This talk can appeal to a broad audience and isn't language specific and affects not only people who are software engineers today, but might be software engineers in the future. Gaining the education and developing the analytical skills to make not only logical, but ethical decisions could have an incredible impact on our industry.
