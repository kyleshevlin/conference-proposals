# Ethical JS: Why Your Next Framework Needs Philosophy

Many students will spend the majority of their academic careers studying mathematics, but rarely study philosophy. Yet philosophy is the area of academics most associated with the study of logic and ethics. As a programmer, I rarely use advanced mathematics, but I use logic on a daily basis. And if I'm doing my job right, I use ethics when I consider not only _what_ I am building, but _why_ I am building it.

We live in a time where we need ethical frameworks more urgently than we need new programming frameworks. The code we write, the products we make, and the apps we build occasionally result in serious negative ethical consequences. Even jail time in certain cases. This can be entirely avoided, but it requires a shift in how we solve our software problems. The study of philosophy, especially logic and ethics can help us make that shift. This talk will discuss why these things are vital to improving the ethical and technological standards of our industry.

## Main Points

* We often hear people lament, "I could never be a programmer, I'm no good at math." This statement is false. Math is not a prerequisite for being good at programming and can proven to be false (using symbolic logic).
* Math, for all its positives, is an inadequate means of teaching logic. It teaches it indirectly. We need direct training in logic, which would be applicable to many more fields than mathematics, including computer science.
* The teaching of formal logic comes from the teaching of philosophy. We need more of this instruction at an earlier age.
* Ethics is one of the most prominent areas of study in philosophy. We need ethics more than ever.
* We as engineers are oriented towards asking and answering the question "how?" How do we do this or that? Philosophy is oriented towards asking the question "why?" Should we not ask "why" we are building something before we ask the question "how"? And shouldn't our answers be more significant than moving the needle?
* The things we design and build have real ethical consequences, people go to jail, crimes go unpunished, and families are ruined.
* It's time that we add the education necessary to our computer science degrees to be able to properly discuss the ethical ramifications of our work. We need ethical frameworks more than we need new JavaScript frameworks.

## Tangential, but potentially useful points

* I have a number of books from the Philosophy & [Insert Movie or TV Show Here] series. Perhaps it could be useful to do a Philosophy & Your Favorite App part of the talk
