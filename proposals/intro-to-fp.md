# Just Enough Functional Programming to be a Danger to Yourself and Coworkers

## Abstract

Functional programming is all the rage these days but can be intimidating to get into with phrases like "functors", "monads" and "category theory" floating about. Instead of getting bogged down in vernacular, let's focus on learning the basic concepts that can lead to some dangerous productivity for you and your team.

## Details

This talk assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming (but does assume an infinite capacity to learn). We start by learning what functional programming is and why we can use these techniques in JavaScript. We work through some necessary concepts, such as higher order functions and pure functions, and eventually arrive at the meat and potatoes of the talk: currying, partial application and composition. Since these might be brand new concepts to lots of people, I break them down with clear examples, using both ES5 and ES6+ JavaScript. Eventually, I show the audience and example of how refactoring some imperative code with functional programming can lead to very clean, easy to understand declarative code. In other words, a refactor both you and your teammates can be excited about.
