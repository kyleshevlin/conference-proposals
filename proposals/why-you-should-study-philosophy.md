# Why Studying Philosophy is More Important than Mathematics for Programmers

## Abstract

You often hear people lament they could never be a good programmer because they weren't good at math. Bullshit. Programming has very little to do with math (people have already written those programmings). It does have a lot to do with logic though, which might be more accurately placed in philosophy.

Alongside logic, though, in our current technological climate, an education in morality and ethics might be one of your most important assets as an engineer as we continue to shape our world through our technological advances.
