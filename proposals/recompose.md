# Title

You Might Not Need `This`: Building React Apps with Recompose and Functional Programming

# Abstract

Interested in React? Functional programming? Learn to combine these interests with Recompose, a library for building React apps with functional programming techniques. Learn how to `compose` a better application and why you might not need `this` ever again.

# Description

Developers love reusable code. It's why we're drawn to JavaScript front end frameworks and libraries. Write one component, use it in a dozen places. It's beautiful. But is that the best we can do? Can we do even better?

Maybe you've written a few components that have the same initial state and wondered, "Can I abstract that?". Or maybe you've had a several components share a few class methods and thought, "Hmmm, I bet I could abstract that, too!" Maybe you've had it in your head that higher order components could be the answer to your abstraction woes if only you could figure out how to use them. Well, wonder no more, my friend. Recompose is the answer.

Recompose is a utility library for enhancing stateless functional components through the use (and, dare I say, abuse) of higher order components. Turn simple, "dumb" components into stateful ones through the library's API and some functional programming techniques.

This talk will focus on writing React with the Recompose library, using  examples to walk through the core methods of the library and build a small app with it. Audience members will learn how to compose components through small, reusable enhancer functions (that almost never use the `this` keyword). Forget component reuse. We can go further.

# Notes

This talk will contain a number of code examples and possibly entail some live coding to show how enhancers are composed for abstractions. I can run all examples locally to avoid any issues that may stem from connectivity problems. We've all been there.

I am a solid public speaker. Prior to becoming a web developer, I served as a pastor for a number of years, and thus, I have had a lot of practice at public speaking.

Since becoming a developer, I have spoken at a number of Portland area meetups on topics like React and Redux. I enjoy engaging with the local community and in the last year have been working on engaging with the larger web developer community through OSS, Reactiflux (where I moderate a channel), and other public spaces. I hope to engage further with the developer community in the Pacific Northwest at SeattleJS.

Lastly, I love React and JavaScript and want to share that passion with others. I want to do a talk on Recompose simply because I've enjoyed learning about it, want to dive deeper and think that any developer that will give it a try will at least walk away with a better understanding of higher order components and how they can improve their applications with them.
