# Title

What I've Learned Since Suggesting and Now Moderating the #jobs-advice Channel on Reactiflux

## Abstract

Have you ever needed some advice or mentorship regarding your current job? Or finding a new one? Have you ever wanted a safe place to discuss salary? Networking techniques? Interview prep? Reactiflux's #jobs-advice channel is a great source for answers to these questions. It's a place of community driven advice, all for the sake of improving each other's quality of life and work. Listen to Kyle Shevlin, suggester and "unofficial" moderator of the channel, discuss some of the best lessons and advice he's learned since its inception.

## Details

The channel is still relatively young, a couple months, but we've already seen a few success stories come out of the efforts of those participating in the channel. We've cleaned up resumes, found people jobs, taught people how to network, talked about negotiating salary. The plan will be to gather some of these stories and use them as talking points, boiled down to the best advice and lessons for all devs.

As of right now, I would want to talk about some of the following points (in the 4 months leading up to React Rally, there may be some newer, better points and examples that could be used):

* Why networking is key and your easiest path to a better job
* Why you shouldn't think of technical interviews as pass/fail
* Why a resume is more than just a list of skills (and why line-height matters)
* Why code school grads should learn older frameworks and libraries, too

My plan is to sprinkle the slides of this talk with some actual statements (screenshots, possibly) from the channel (with permission, of course), and of course, some great gifs to go along. Primarily, this will be a light hearted talk, but with some serious implications on how all developers can improve their career by improving their soft skills. I'll end with an invitation for people to join in the conversation of the channel, helping one another grow as developers.

## Pitch

There is a growing hunger (and need) for soft skills advice in our industry. Reactiflux's #jobs-advice channel is a great place to sate that hunger. Whether you're trying to land your first gig, or you're up for a promotion, there are those in the community with the experience and ideas to help you. By accepting this talk, the React community at large will learn about this new resource and be encouraged to participate in it. We all benefit from sharing our collective knowledge and expertise. Think of it as open sourcing soft skill development. I am an engaging speaker, drawing upon years of public speaking experience in my previous career as a pastor, and I believe I can put those to good use at React Rally sharing these lessons with everyone.
